# Movie-Recommendation-Engine
Movie recommendation engine is a recommendation based engine that are used by many web entertainment companies like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hotstar etc. I have also made this project as my academic project but with algorithmic change, here I have used an Cosine similarity algorithm. The whole project is made using programming language named Python _3.

As the project is consisting of big dataset and the source code is connected with the dataset named MOVIE_DATASET taken from Movielens website, I am not able to add my code tothe github but I am adding my screenshots of the code with output for your reference.
